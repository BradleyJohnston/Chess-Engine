# Chess-Engine
This will be updated with an optimized version of https://github.com/BradleyJohnston/ChessBoardGame that includes the missing features as well as a GUI. From there I plan on implementing a computer to play against. I intend to do this with the Minimax algorithm and using a Neural Network for the scoring function.

This project is a placeholder to remind me to get back to it, however I got to a decent point with it in the prototype and I want to play around with some Unity projects.
